# Problem Statement 
This is our Project titled "Mobile Price & Battery Life Prediction" in which we will be able to predict the Price of any Mobile phone and life of its battery from different parameters like Battery Power, RAM, 4G etc. We will use different Regression models to accomplish our task.
## Dataset

The dataset which we have used is "Mobile Price Classification" from Kaggle. Link-> https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification . There is two variable to be predicted seperately. 

1) Battery Power which will be a regression task.<br>
2) Mobile Price Range which will be a classification task.<br>

<ins>Battery Power</ins>:
Mean Battery Power: 1238.03 mAh<br>
Max Battery Power: 1998 mAh<br>
Min Battery Power: 501 mAh<br>

<ins>Mobile Price Range</ins>:<br>
There are 4 class labels:<br>
1. Low Cost(0)<br>
2. Medium Cost(1)<br>
3. High Cost(2)<br>
4. Very High Cost(3)<br>
